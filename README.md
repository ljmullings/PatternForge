# Pattern Forge
PatternForge is a desktop application that transforms images of clothing into detailed 3D models and sewing patterns. Designed for hobbyists, professionals, and educators, it blends machine learning and intuitive user interfaces to simplify the garment design and production process.

By using advanced 3D mesh generation and pattern extraction technologies, PatternForge offers a seamless workflow for users to create, visualize, and export sewing patterns or 3D assets. Whether you're a game developer, cosplayer, or sewing enthusiast, PatternForge adapts to your creative needs.

## Applications
1. Hobby Sewing
Generate accurate sewing patterns for custom garments.
Export patterns as PDFs or SVGs for printing and use at home.
2. Cosplay Design
Create tailored patterns and 3D models to bring unique costume ideas to life.
Adjust garment proportions to match individual measurements.
3. 3D Modeling and Game Development
Export 3D garment meshes in OBJ or STL formats.
Use meshes in 3D design tools or integrate them into game environments.
4. Fashion Design Education
Teach garment construction and sewing techniques using visual tools.
Enable students to explore garment adjustments and pattern generation interactively.
5. Rapid Prototyping
Quickly iterate on garment designs with automated pattern generation.
Visualize changes in real time on a 3D mannequin.


## Tech Stack
#### Frontend
React.js: Provides a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Three.js: Enables real-time 3D visualization and interactive garment adjustments.
